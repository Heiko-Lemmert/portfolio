The BDSG contains special provisions regarding the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes, transmission, and automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling.

In particular, instead of the terms used in the Swiss DPA such as \"processing\" of \"personal data\", \"overriding interest\" and \"particularly sensitive personal data\", the terms used in the GDPR \"processing\" of \"personal data\", \"legitimate interest\" and \"special categories of data\" are used.

    "paragraph-2": "These measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data, as well as access to, input of, disclosure of, ensuring availability of and segregation of data. Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure the exercise of data subject rights, deletion of data, and responses to data compromise. In addition, we consider the protection of personal data during the development and selection of hardware, software and procedures in accordance with the principle of data protection through technology design and data protection-friendly default settings.",
    "paragraph-3": "Securing of online connections through TLS/SSL encryption technology (HTTPS): To protect users' data transmitted via our online services from unauthorized access, we employ TLS/SSL encryption technology. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are the cornerstones of secure data transmission on the internet. These technologies encrypt the information transmitted between the website or app and the user's browser (or between two servers), thereby protecting the data from unauthorized access. TLS, as the more advanced and secure version of SSL, ensures that all data transmissions comply with the highest security standards. When a website is secured by an SSL/TLS certificate, this is indicated by the display of HTTPS in the URL. This serves as an indicator to users that their data is being transmitted securely and encrypted."

    "paragraph-2": "For data transfers to the USA, we primarily rely on the Data Privacy Framework (DPF), which was recognized as a secure legal framework by an adequacy decision of the EU Commission dated July 10, 2023. Additionally, we have concluded Standard Contractual Clauses with the respective providers that comply with the requirements of the EU Commission and establish contractual obligations to protect your data.",
    "paragraph-3": "This dual safeguard ensures comprehensive protection of your data: the DPF forms the primary level of protection, while the Standard Contractual Clauses serve as additional security. Should changes occur within the framework of the DPF, the Standard Contractual Clauses serve as a reliable fallback option. This ensures that your data remains appropriately protected even in the event of any political or legal changes.",
